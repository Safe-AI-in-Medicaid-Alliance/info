# Safe AI in Medicaid Alliance (SAMA)

Welcome to the Safe AI in Medicaid Alliance. SAMA is a public-private initiative working to define safe, practical, and program-aligned uses of AI across the Medicaid enterprise.

We are focused on:
- Developing responsible AI use guidelines grounded in Medicaid program values
- Sharing real-world policies and use cases from states and partners
- Aligning with national frameworks such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- Building toward shared deliverables at MESC 2025

## Definition of SAFE AI

SAMA has adopted the following definition of the term **SAFE AI**:

> **Safe AI in Medicaid refers to the ethical, accountable, and transparent use of AI tools that improve program operations while maintaining fairness, human oversight, and compliance with privacy and legal standards.**

### Adopted Materials

**State Medicaid AI Use Cases, Risk Evaluation Framework, and Implementation Guide:**
